# **Binary Tree Based Evaluator**
### This the fourth assignment in the course 'Principles of Software Design'
-----

###### **Given this is part of a series of assignments from a course, I do not condone plagarism. Please don't copy my code and claim as yours.**
-----

## **Assignment Details**
- Purpose: Utilize the Composition, Visitor, and Builder pattern to design an expression evaluator.
- Given: Shells files were not given in this assignment. 
- Notes: Implementation of functions were my own logic.

## **How To Run Program**
- Download Repository
- In Command Line:
  - 'make run' : compiles and runs program 
  - 'make clean' : to removes additional files made during compilation
-----

## **Examples**
- ### There should be a spaces between each token. Press 'enter' to evaluate input expression.
----- 
- Example 1: Demonstrates the capability to handle positive and negative integers. It also displays the ability to handle the order of operations properly.

## **Addition Notes**
###### This was originally compiled using [MPC](https://github.com/DOCGroup/MPC). I made my own Makefile to make things easier.
